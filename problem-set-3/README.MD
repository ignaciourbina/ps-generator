# PS 3 â€” Inference for Two Proportions, and Means Under Large and Small Samples

## Topics covered in the problem set

- Inference for the difference of two proportions.
- Inference for one population mean.
- Inference for two population means.

The web quiz is still a placeholder. `problem_set_blueprint.md` lists twenty
planned MCQs, and `validate_problemset3_computations.py` offers sanity checks
for the computational items.

Once the HTML quiz is finalised, create `question_bank.json` via:

```bash
python ../../tools/extract_questions.py web_app/index.html question_bank.json
```
